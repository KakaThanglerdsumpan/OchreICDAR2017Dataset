 Fryer, that I seeing this prodigall like to starve for want of food, lent him money, not onely to buy him victuals, but also to redeeme his lands and pay his debts, conditionarily that so soone as his debts were paid, that hee should give himselfe freely to mee, to this, here is his hand shewing him the bond now my time is expired, for all his debts are paid, which hee cannot denie. This case is plaine, if it be so that his debts are paid his silence confirmes it said the Divell, therefore give him a iust sentence. I will said Fryer Bacon but first tell me speaking to the gentleman didst thouneveryetgive theDevillany of hismony backe, nor requite him any wayes never had hee any thing of me as yet answered the gentleman then never let him have any thing of thee and thou art free deceiver of mankind, said he speaking to the Devill it was thy bargaine, never to meddle with him so long as hee was indebted to any, now how canst thou demand of him any thing, when he is indebted for all that hee hath to thee, when hee payeth thee thy money, then take him as thy due till then thou hast nothing to doe with him and so I charge thee to be gone. At this, the Devill vanished with great horror, but Fryer Bacon comforted the gen-tleman, and sent him home with a quiet conscience bidding him never to pay the Devils money backe as he tendred his owne safety which he promised for to observe.
