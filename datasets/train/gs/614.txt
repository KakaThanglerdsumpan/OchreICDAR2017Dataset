 had long time brought them vp, yet did they nothing regard it, but behind his backe in most scorne-full sort derided him, and both in  and actions greatly abuse him, reuerence they would doe none vnto him, but when they spake, it was in such malapert sort, as would grieue an honest minde to heare it. At last it came to passe, that breaking out into meere contempt, they said they would stay no longer with him, and that it was a great discredit for them, to serue a person so beggerly whereupon they thought it conue-nient to seeke for their benefits elsewhere. When the distressed man found the matter so plaine being in great griefe, he spake thus vnto them Now do I find, to my sorrow, thesmall trust that is in this false world. Why, my Masters quoth he haue you so much forgotten my former prosperity, that you nothing regard my present necessity ? In your wants I forsooke you not, in your sicknesse I left you not, nor despised you in your great pouerty it is not vnknowne, though you doe not con-sider it, that I tooke some of you vp in the high-way, othersome from your needy parents, and brought the rest from meere beggery to a house of bounty where from paltrie boyes, I brought you vp to mans state, and haue, to my great cost, taught you a trade, whereby you may liue like men. And in requitall of all my courtesie, cost and good will, will you now on a sudden forsake me ? Is this the best recompence that you can find your hearts to yeeld mee ?
