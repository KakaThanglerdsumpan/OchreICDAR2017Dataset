 characters and spells but is in the following tale transformed from the greatest philosopher of his age into a beneficent and powerful conjuror. The history of Fryer Bacon as related in these pages, was probably written towards the close of the sixteenth century, and is we may suppose a collection of the various traditions respecting him which were current among all classes of the community when the narrative was compiled. Many of the incidents con-tained in it are widely diffused in other shapes, and the name of our hero has doubtless often been con-nected with them merely from their being mutual subjects of popular fable but the Brazen Head and the wonderful Perspective Glass, which he is reported to have made, seem deserving of particular notice, though any credit which may be given to him for his exertions in constructing such a head, by the which hee would have walled England round with brass, he will I fear have to share with so many who are said to have possessed similar skill in the construction of magical images that it will be consi-derably diminished. Virgil is reported to have con-structed certain images called Salvacio Romae, which are fully described in that extraordinary production the Lyfe of Virgilius which will be found in the second volume of this collection.
