104 THE PLEASANT HISTORIE suddenly turned backe, and called for a capcase which lay in the Warehouse. The seruant could not find the key by any meanes. Whereupon hee caUed to haue the locke broke open. Which they within hearing, opened the doore of their owne accord. So soone as her husband espied her in that place, with admiration he said 0 passion of my heart, what doe you here? what, you two that cannot abide one another ? what make you so close together ? is your chiding and ray ling, brabling, and braiding, come to this ? O what dissemblers are these ! Why, my Oast, qd. Cutbert, what need you take the matter so hot ? I gaue a Cheese to my Country-man Hodgekins, to lay vp, and deHuered it to your wife to be keept and then is it not reason, that she should come and seeke me my Cheese ? O, quoth the old man, belike the dore was lockt, because the Cheese should not run away. The doore said his wife vnknowne to vs clapt to it selfe, and hauing a spring locke, was presently fast. WeU, huswife, qd. he, I wdl giue you as much credit as a Crocadde, but as for your companion, I wid teach him to come hither to looke Cheeses. And with that he caused bis men to take him pre sently, and to bind him hand and foot. Which being done, they drew him vp in a basket into the smoky louer of the haU, and there they did let him hang all that night, euen tdl the next day dinner time, when he should haue beene at the banquet with the Princes for neither Hodgekins nor Martin could intreat their inflamed Oast to let him downe.
