Fortunate SAILOR, OR The dlreeii Bed. The 'Bonny English Hose. A story, a story to you I will tell, Concerning a sailor that's known very well. Concerning a sailor that's very well known, Who is ragged and patched like one that is poor. . When that he had landed he bethought him of a plot. And went unto a alehouse where he used to lodge at,' You're welcome home dear Johnny, you're welcome home from sea. You're welcome home dear Johnny, said the landlady so free. List night my daughter Molly was dreaming of thee, And your daughter Molly 1 could wish to see. For 1 have had a bad niisfoi tane, my ship and caroro is ost. And on the briny ocean my fortune has been'erosh Bring in a pot of beer and sit down by me. Fetch down your daughter Molly and set her on my knee My daughter Molly's busy John, and cannot come to you Neither will 1 credit you with one pot or two. Johnny being drowsy he bung down his head, He called for a candle to lisfht him to bed. My beds they're engaged, and have been all tbe week, Therefore for fresh lodgings you must seek. If to a freih lodging you force me to go, Tell me what 1 owe you and I will pay you now. It is five and forty shillings John, you owe to me of old With that John pulied out bis two hands full of gold. Tbe sight of the gold the landlady knew not what tn She said John sit down while I go ard fetch some drink If Johnny was in earnest, vow I was in j'St, Of all young men io this world 1 love young Jobny best The green bed is empty, and as been all this week, You and my daughter Molly may take a pleasant sleep, Before I would lay within your hous I would lay upon the floor, , For if I had no morey you'd have turned me ont _pf doors But I have money in my pocket, I can sing, drink, rant, and roar, While the brown jugs and glasses come tumbling to the loor, Come all yeni bris young sailors that ploughs tbe raging main. Who are getting your money through stormy winds and rain,' Be careful ef your money boys and lay it up in store, Foe wken all your money's gone, they will kick you out of doors. Old England's emblem is tlie rose, There is no other flower. Hath lialf the graces that adorn. Tlie beauty of that flower, And Bug-lands daughters are as fair. As any hud that blows. What son of hei's who has not loved, Some Bonny English Rose. Who bath not beard of one sweet slower The fust among tbe f dr. For whose welfare a British, Hath breath'd a fervent prayer, , may it never be her lot, To lose that sweet repose, That peace of mind which blesses now, The Bonny English Rose. If any bold enough thvc be. To war 'gainst England's isle. 1 hev soon shall find for Br'uisbwhrar'.s What charms bath woman's smile. Thus nerv'd the thunder of their arms, Would teach aspiring foes, How vain the power that defies, The Bonny English Rose '. Now heaven decrees her to the tb one, '1'ivi'l be llie nation's prayer. That in each joy she had not l .own, Her heart may ever share, That health may long light up her brow, And as time onward flows, It still may be our pride to sing, The Bonny English Rose. Beneath be sway mnv every land. Where sh d uiinions holds, Befnijipv as Tie glorious isles TrM ere Freedom's flag unfolds, Fjom sea to shore, from shore to sea, H#ie song of gladness, And oh, may leaven for ever bless, The U nny English Rose.
