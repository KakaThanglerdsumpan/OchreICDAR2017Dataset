THOMAS OF READING. Thomas of Beading, or the Sixe Worthie Yeomen of the West, is the production of Thomas Deloney, a famous baUad maker in his day, in which latter character he appears to have drawn upon him self the indignation of Kemp, one of the original actors of Shakspeare . Kemp is celebrated for his miraculous morris-dance, performed in nine days from London to Norwich but this feat having been misre presented in the popular ballads, Kemp thus remon strates against our author. I have made a priuie search what priuate jig-monger of your jolly num ber had been the author of these abhominable badets written of me. I was told it was the great badade-maker, T. D. or Thomas Deloney, chro-nicler of the memorable Lives of the ' Six Yeomen of the West,' ' Jack of Newberry ' the Gentle Craft,' and such like honest men, omitted by Stowe, HoUinshed, Grafton, Had, Froysart, and the rest of those wed-deserving writers. See Kemp's Nine Dales Wonder performed in a Daunce from jLondon to Norwich, edited by the Rev. Alex. Dyce for the Camden Society.
