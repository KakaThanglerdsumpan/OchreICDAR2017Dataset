Theat. de France, p. 109, which doubt-less refers to the same Robert. Of this extraordinary production two translations into English have been printed one in verse which was republished by Mr. Herbert, 8vo. 1798 from a MS. formerly in the possession of Mr. Ratcliffe, which appears to have been transcribed word for word from an edition by AVynkyn de Worde or Pynson, of which Mr. Herbert had seen a fragment consisting of six leaves. This English Metrical Version is in eight line stanzas, and commences as follows, Lysten lordinges that of marueyles lyke to heare, Of acts that were done sometyme in dede By oure elders that before vs were How some in myschieffe their lyfe dyd leade And in this boke may ye se yf that ye will rede Of one Robert the deuyll, borne in Normandye, That was as uengeable a man as myht treade On goddes grounde for he delyted in all tyranye.
