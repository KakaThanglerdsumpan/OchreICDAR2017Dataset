OF THOMAS OF READING. 87 How Grays wife of Glocester, with one or two more of her neighbours went to the Faire, where seruants came to be hired, and how she tooke the Earle of Shrewesburies Daughter into her seruice, Chap. 3. It was wont to be an old custome in Glocestershire, that at a certaine time in the yeere, ad such young men and Maidens as were out of seruice, resorted to a faire that was kept neere Glocester, there to be ready for any that would come to hire them, the young men stood allona row on the one side, and the maidens on the other. It came to pass, that the Earle of Shrewsburies daughter, whose father was lately banished, being driven into great distresse, and weary with traueU, as one whose deficate Hfe was neuer vsed to such toyle, sate her downe vponthe high-way side, making this lamentation 0 false and deceitftdl world, quoth she ! who is in thee that wishes not to be rid of thee, for thy extremities are great ?
