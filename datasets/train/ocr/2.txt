Some people think that they can judge, Man's temper by his cast of features -But sure their system is all fudge, To prove such folks but stupid creatures, For if he has a clownish face, A phiz with ignorance all teeming, Yet by his actions you may trace. He's not so simyle as he's seeming, Ami so it is, indeed, with I, b'or though I look as if I'm dreaming. It is because I'm rather shy, I'm not so simple as I'm seeming.

The gloriious lamp, or Heavenly Sun, The higher he is getting, The sooner will his lace be run, Nearer to east is setting. Then gather, Sec. When in the days of youth and love, The heart with joy is glowing, O remember age will soon remove, Those plaasiue's now are flowing, Then be not coy, use year time, As you may go many, For having lost but once your prime, You may for ever tarry.
