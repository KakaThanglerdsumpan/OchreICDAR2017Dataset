OF FRYER BACON. 207 treated Mdes that he would watch whilst that they slept, and caU them if the head speake. Feare not, good master said Mdes I wdl not sleepe, but harken and attend upon the head, and if it doe chance to speake, I wiU caU you therefore I pray take you both your rests and let mee alone for watching this head. After Fryer Bacon had given him a great charge the second time Fryer Bungy and he went to sleepe, and Miles, alone to watch the brasen head Mdes, to keepe him from sleeping, got a tabor and pipe, and being merry disposed, sung this song to a Northren tune OF CAM'ST THOU NOT FROM NEW-CASTLE. To couple is a custome, all things thereto agree Why should not I then love? since love to all is free. But Ue have one that's pretty, her cheekes of scarlet die, For to breed my delight, when that I ligge her by. Though vertue be a dowry, yet lie chuse money store If my love prove untrue, with that I can get more. The faire is oft unconstant, the blacke is often proud. lie chuse a lovely browne, come fidler scrape thy crowd.
