111 OF THOMAS OF READING. Hke a man of Law at the Barre, and he wagers with them four crownes to twaine the others agreed, to worke they go but Crab conquered them all. Where upon the London Weauers were nipt in the head Hke birds, and had not a word to say. Now, saith Crab, as we haue lost nothing, so you haue wonne nothing, and because I know you cannot be right Weauers, except you be good-feUowes, therefore if you wid goe with vs, we wdl bestow the Ale vpon you. That is spoken like a good-fedow and like a Weauer, quoth the other. So along they went as it were to the signe of the red Crosse. When they were set downe, and had drunke well, they began merrily to prattle, and to extoU Crab to the skies. Whereupon Crab protested, that hee would come and dwell among them. Nay, that must not be, said a London Weauer the King bath giuen vspriuiledge,that none should Hue among us, hut such as serue seuen yeeres in London. With that Crab, according to his old lnaner of prophesying, said thus The day is very neere at hand, When as the King of this faire Land, Shal priuiledge you more then so Then Weauers shall in skarlet goe. And to one brotherhood be brought, The first is in London wrought, When other Trades-men by your fame, Shall couet all to doe the same.
